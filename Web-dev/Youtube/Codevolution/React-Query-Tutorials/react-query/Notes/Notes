# React Query

- ! By default the react query automatically retry(4-times) if the error occurred
- ! The React Query Cache , by default every query result cached 5mins

- StaleTime is the length of time before your data becomes stale. The default value in React Query is staleTime: 0 - which means your data is immediately stale! In React Query, your data can be fresh or stale. If it's fresh, the saved (cached) data will be used repeatedly, without more API calls to the server
