useReducer()

Pure Components

if the state is not changed but the component was re-rendered
eg:
    Take a example of the counter application
    There are two buttons for incrementing and Button(set to zero)
    Once the state is set to zero , again click Button(set to zero)
    The component will be re-rendered but the state will not be changed
    
    ShouldComponentUpdate

If the component State or Props was updated but the updated state and props was same its not re-rendering
